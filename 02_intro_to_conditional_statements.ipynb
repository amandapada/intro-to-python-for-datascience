    "\n",
    "In Python, indentation refers to the spaces or tabs placed at the beginning of a line of code. Unlike many other programming languages that use curly braces or keywords to define code blocks, Python uses indentation as a fundamental part of its syntax to indicate the structure and scope of code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation is used to group related statements together, forming code blocks within constructs like if statements, for loops, while loops, function definitions, and class definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper indentation is not merely a style preference in Python; it is a strict syntax requirement. Incorrect or inconsistent indentation will lead to *IndentationError* or *TabError*.\n",
    "\n",
    "All lines within a single code block must be indented by the **same amount of whitespace**. If a block needs to be nested further, it is simply indented by an additional level.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the specific number of spaces per indentation level is not strictly enforced by the language, the widely accepted convention is to use four spaces for each level of indentation. Mixing tabs and spaces within the same file is generally discouraged and can lead to issues."
